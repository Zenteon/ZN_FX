**Zentient ReShade Shaders**

An ever growing list of beautiful lightweight effects to enhance your gaming experience.

**Current Effects list:**
    
    DAMP RT (ZN_DAMP_RT.fx)
The sucessor to SDIL, DAMP RT (Depth-Aware Mipmapped Ray Tracing) is significantly higher quality, better optimized, and more polished overall.
If you do wish to download SDIL, it can still be found in the "Shaders" folder, but it's recommended to use DAMP RT instead.
Note: DAMP RT is still a work in progress, and subject to change.

A tasteful pixel art and color curve shader for those tired of realism in games.
Many configurable options for those who might not want everything it has to offer.

    Zentient Wireframe (ZN_WF.fx)
A simple and relatively lightweight shader to display front facing meshes for that "2000's hacker vibe."
